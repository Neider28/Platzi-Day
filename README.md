# ðŸ’šPlatzi DayðŸ’š
This landing page is a Platzi challenge about the creation of my first website. The challenge was to finish the final HTML and CSS course in three weeks and recreate a Platzi Day page with the acquired knowledge. It is a simple static page but I consider it a good start to begin as a web developer. You can visit my page challenge here: [Link project](https://neider28.github.io/Platzi-Day/ "Link project"). I hope you like it and don't forget to visit Platzi at the following link: [Platzi.com](http://platzi.com "Platzi.com")
